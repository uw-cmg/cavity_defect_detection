# cavity_defect_detection
Mask R-CNN model to detect cavity defects in electron microscopy image. Also included is a random forest model to predict the detection F1 score as a measure of prediction performance

## Run example notebooks in Google Colab:

Make predictions of image F1 score with Random forest model and object predictions with Mask R-CNN using final model fit to all data
